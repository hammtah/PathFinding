Add a benchmark (requests, threads, duration...);why you choose crow
[x]add BFS algorithm
Refactor code
add mazes
add swamp with weight > 1 to show difference between dijkstra and bfs
add battle mode : the two algos start at the same time in different colors;If they overlap, it turns Purple.
BFS:(//add strategy pattern)
used for unweighted graphs, traverse all nodes level by level starting with the root then its adjacent nodes
the first time we achieve the end node then this is the shortest path
